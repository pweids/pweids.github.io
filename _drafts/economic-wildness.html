<p><!-- /wp:heading --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>How wild are you? Economic wildness is a concept introduced to me by <a href="http://sebastianmarshall.com/">Sebastian Marshall</a>. He defines it as "knowing accurately your past, present, and future economics."</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It's a simple calculus: Of all the money you spent last month, how much would you be able to account for? Sure you know how much you spent on rent, maybe a rough idea of your cell phone bill. But groceries? Amazon impulse buys? Gas? It gets fuzzier and fuzzier.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The percentage of money you can't account for to total money you spent is your economic wildness. If you remember that you spent $1,000 on rent, but can't attribute where the rest of the $3,000 you spent last month was, you have a wildness of $2,000/$3,000 = 66.6%. Pretty bad.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>What about next month? Do you know what you've already committed to and what you'll be able to freely spend? If you had to make an emergency payment (say a car repair, medical bill, etc.), do you know how you will handle it? Have you saved enough? Or know where you can easily reduce spending?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Your economic wildness is like a your personal credit risk -- the higher it is, the riskier it is to lend to yourself, and the more likely you'll fall into a debt spiral.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A higher wildness is a source of stress and limits your ability to be spontaneous. Yes, by being more disciplined and less wild economically, you can be more spontaneous and wild in real life. You know, where it <em>actually</em> matters.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>So how wild are you?</p>

<p>For over 3 years, I've had an economic wildness of 0%. That is, over the last 3 years I can account for every penny I've earned or spent.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>I developed a very simple spreadsheet system and used a good amount of consistent discipline to instill the logging habit. It took about a month of tweaking and logging until I got it down. I've learned what works and doesn't. </p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In this post I'll share the system I developed and how you can use it yourself.</p>

<ul>
<li>budget apps that automatically pull from credit card data</li>
<li>"giving every dollar a job"</li>
<li>just saving receipts</li>
