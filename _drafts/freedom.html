<p>    The Takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>We all strive for freedom, but either fail to define it or take it upon assumption</li>
<li>Question everything, your assumptions, your religions. Only you can define success for you.</li>
<li>For me, success is freedom. So the task becomes to decide what freedom means.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>We all want freedom. "Give me liberty or give me death!" he shouted. What is this mythical freedom we chase but never know where to aim? Everyone has a different definition of freedom. Here's mine.</p>
<p>I've been a Libertarian for all of my adult life. The key word here being "liberty" of course. What does it mean? Typically, and the way in can be distilled in one sentence, is maximizing political, social and economic freedom amongst all peoples. In policy, it often means restricting others (read: the government) from infringing upon life, liberty or property. As interesting as this is, I do not mean this type of political liberty when I say that I strive for freedom. I have no plans to dump non-fair trade tea into the Hudson River or arm myself with an M4A1 and deprive foreigners of their life, liberty, and property.</p>
<p>Instead, I refer to a more solipsistic freedom within my own life. This, to me, means success.</p>
<p>But for the first part of leading a successful life, the word "success" must be defined. After all, how can you aim for something you can't see. All too often, however, that definition of success is wrapped in the hallowed and sacred rites of the American Religion. You know this well: go to a good college, stay on the sidewalks, have a long and safe career, pay your bills, start and raise a functional family, mortgage a suburban house, grow lasting wealth, enjoy an easy retirement, succumb to a late death.</p>
<p>Taking this road is the highway of life. You must pay to get on and off, you are pulled over for disobeying the rules, you are constantly surrounded by a swarm of big trucks, billboard advertisements, cheap shitty food; and it's over so quickly you never realized there is civilization–life, love, lament and all its accompanying poetry–happening in the capillaries all around you beyond the windows–the television screens–of your sole vehicle. But you never know it because your map is not detailed enough and you complain that the highways are always full of traffic and you release an exasperated sigh every time you see "Road Work Ahead."</p>
<p>The fundamentals of this religion, like all religions, come from your parents. The priests and priestesses of proper democratized Western civilian-hood. However, the marked attribution of our generation is questioning this religion, these assumptions. We no longer take things at face value. Which is great! Even the Buddha himself said "question everything, even me." Or quite likely something more poetic than that. In fact, our generation is in greater numbers more atheistic, even to the point of seeing staunch believers as a little <em>off. </em>They tend to get lumped in with the hyper-zealous, under-educated, and ever small minded religious right. But the older generation is still the biggest voting bloc, so no politician would dare deny the promise of the everlasting banquet/family-reunion that awaits us good citizens after death. Of course not, their families are perfect. Of course they want to spend the rest of eternity with their spirits.</p>
<p><small>I'm certainly not the first person to wax philosophical about these topics. In fact, I suggest you read James Altucher's blog to get the perspective of someone who has more experience, writing skills, and time invested in these ideas. Certainly, many of mine are influenced by him.</small></p>
<p>"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, I am free at last!"</p>
