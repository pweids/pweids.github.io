<p>I love travel. I believe it is incredibly important to see ne</p>
<p>I am biased, of course. The majority of my conversations here in L.A. have been of the LA vs NYC and "boy, isn't the weather nice out here" ilk.</p>
<p>Yes, you're weather is beautiful. I mean really fucking beautiful. T-shirt weather all year, blue skies, palm trees, attractive people who don't hide their perfect bodies in huge down jackets for an entire season. Gotta hand it to you.</p>
<p>But god damn are you full of your own shit. LA is the lower-back tramp stamp of cities. And it's a big, colorful, laid-back butterfly. One giant festering ego.</p>
<p>NYC has ego, but not in the same way. NYC isn't about being the center of attention. NYC is about money, success -- it's about control. New Yorkers want to control their environment, control their lives. I get it: so do I. We are ambitious, money-hungry, but ever so realistic. We care about image as an extent of our power.</p>
