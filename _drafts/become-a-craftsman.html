<p>I've always admired the dedication and skill of the craftsman. I'm talking about the men (usually men) who start young as an apprentice woodworker and 10 years later are able to hand craft some of the most beautiful and ornate oak tables that will last generations. A lot of our economy shifted to knowledge-work where outcomes can be faked and people develop more skills to verbally dance around a problem all the while self-promoting and putting others down. In fact, one of the most valuable things I learned in high-school and college is how to bullshit.</p>
<p>That dedication to a skill is lost on our generation. People who take up traditional crafts and trades do it because they don't need to be educated for it. In the more upper-class white collar environment that I grew up in, such crafts are seen as a waste of a college degree or a squandering of opportunity.</p>

<p>We need to make money, and money is made from 9-5 in an artificially-lighted office park.</p>
<p>I romanticize it a little. My overactive imagination is quick to take on a grass-is-always-greener approach to different lifestyles and approaches. Mostly, though, people who focus on crafts and trades do it wrong. They do it to make enough money to afford rent and a few six packs.</p>
<p>But leave it to the Japanese to do it right.</p>

<p>"Once you decide on your occupation you must immerse yourself in work. You have to fall in love with your work. Never complain about your job. You must dedicate your life to mastering your skill. That's the secret of success and the key to being regarded honorably." -Jiro Ono</p>
<p>Watch this movie. Jiro Dreams of Sushi. It's a brilliant expose about a man dedicated to his craft. He's an 85 year old sushi chef who tirelessly and relentlessly strives for perfection. Even after all these years, he focuses on improving his skill and the quality of his sushi. His dedication not only to his craft, but to improving his skill, awarded him a Michelin 3-Star rating and the honor of being a recognized "Living National Treasure" by the government of Japan.</p>

<p>Too many people with a craft or a skill do just enough to be adequate. They fall short in trying to improve when they become "good enough." As Jiro says, you must fall in love with your work and master the skill.</p>
<p>The important thing here is that love for ones work comes sometimes years after this dedication. Our generation believes that we should find what we love and do that. But if I were to walk the streets of D.C. until I "fell in love at first sight" with a woman, how happy and successful do you think my love life will be? It takes work.</p>
<p>It takes time and dedication, and eventually you will love the work you do. Become a craftsman, master your skill, and quit complaining about your job.</p>
<p>And respect your elders. Thank you, Jiro.</p>
