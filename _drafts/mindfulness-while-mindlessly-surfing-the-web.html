<p>I'll be talking a lot about the buddhist-inspired concept of "mindfulness." It's something I believe can help enhance the enjoyment of everyday and occasional events. Rather than explaining the concept fully, just Google it. In short, however, it means living in the moment and trying to focus all of your attention on the food, walk, activity, friend, what have you that you are currently experiencing.</p>
<p>I try to practice mindfulness during my daily activities, but unless I'm consciously thinking about mindfulness, I almost never attain such focus. The ironic bit is that once you start trying to attain mindfulness, then your thoughts are not focused on the experience but they are also crowded by thoughts of keeping focus on that experience. It's much like when you are conscious of your own breathing patterns. Follow?</p>
<p>Basically, mindfulness for me is not "muscle memory," or whatever the brain-equivalent is.</p>
<p>But this is for another post.</p>
<p>Here's a little tip I just discovered for myself: pay attention to your hands.</p>
<p>I find myself engaging in almost always fruitless, yet easily justifiable, web surfing and blog reading. In particular, I began watching a music video at my favorite music blog, <a href="http://emptnyc.com">Et Musique Pour Tous</a>. My left and right hands were on the keyboard and mouse, respectively. They were like a baseball player in the "athletic stance," ready to move and act at any second.</p>
<p>I started feeling that urge. The instinctual urge much like hunger, thirst, or even sexual arousal--or the feeling that makes you want to turn on your side while lying in bed. You can't really describe it, but you know it when you feel it.</p>
<p>It was the societally nascent urge to start browsing other sites or consume other instantly gratifying media while listening to this song. It's as if almost anything is better than just relaxing and watching the video.</p>
<p>So I took my hands off the keyboard and mouse and set them down in front of me. Now any time they drifted towards the mouse and keyboard, much like on a&nbsp;Ouija&nbsp;board, I became conscious and could stop the urge to divert my attention before my hindbrain could make that decision for me.</p>
<p>Try it out. Next time you're listening to a song or watching a video, put your hands on your desk or in your lap and try to just sit there the whole duration. Drink in the material, the art, the entertainment; enjoy the moment.</p>
