<p><em>I almost forgot about this blog. In fact, I even lost the login. But it's back. I figure well nobody really reads these things anyways, so what do I have to lose. At least it'll be a good medium for me to "journal" and keep track of my constantly meandering thoughts.</em></p>
<p>This is a conversation I seem to have with some frequency. It usually comes after a few drinks at PHI bar on a Thursday night.</p>
