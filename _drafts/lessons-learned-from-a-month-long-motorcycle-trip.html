<p>In the middle of September, I returned to NYC from my month-long motorcycle trip. This sounds like the "trip of a lifetime" or an enjoyable retreat, but it marked the beginning of the most difficult period in my life so far -- and I entered this period knowingly. The next weeks and months I'll be launching a job search as well as exploring possible business ventures. Nothing is certain except my dream: to run a company and execute an idea.</p>
<p>To pull the trip off, I first quit my job. A myriad of factors were influential in this -- not the least of which is just a wanderlust I often feel -- but the decision came from a two week long retreat into seclusion I took in May. Always introspective, I had the clarity to sit myself down outside of any social, professional, or other pressures and ask myself: "if I am being true to what I believe in and what I desire, would I still be doing what I am doing today?" The answer, after a skipped heartbeat, was decidedly "no."</p>
<p>Every day when you look in the mirror in the morning ask yourself: <strong>"Today am I living for myself or for someone else?" </strong>Or as Steve Jobs would put it, "If I were to die today, is this what I would be doing?" If the answer is "no" too many days in a row, well, then quit and take a motorcycle trip! But quitting is the easy part...</p>

Without going into the details of the trip (feel free to ask me in person. I can give you the 2 sentence version of the 2 hour version), here are a few things I learned:</p>
<p><strong>1) Retreating and hiding from problems will not reveal any answers</strong></p>
<p>A large part of the reason I wanted to go on this trip was to just "get away." Running away from problems or situations won't solve them. Tackle them head on and with gusto to expect any results. Now I do believe that isolating yourself from social and technological distractions can help, but the key here is to still be working, writing, reading. Just checking your brain out won't help.</p>
<p><strong>2) Communication is the most important part of any partnership</strong></p>
<p>I'm finding over and over again that communication is the most important part of a functioning team (from business to relationships). Honesty builds trust, and communication makes sure it is flowing. See, often times we don't want to communicate our desires or our feelings out of fear of breaking down the relationship. But think of communication like treating cancer: the sooner something is identified and addressed the smaller of a problem it will be. Not to mention bottling things up tends to build inner resentment towards the other person. Caveat: <strong>do not</strong> communicate from a heightened emotional state. This state will be reflected by the other person and will wreak havoc.</p>
<p><strong>3) The Value of a network</strong></p>
<p>This can be stated very simply: the more people we knew, the more places we could crash. The best example of this was the couchsurfer we met in Asheville, NC who hooked us up with a place to stay in Portland, OR.</p>
<p><strong>4) My own personal limits</strong></p>
<p>I already explored this one last year when climbing Kilimanjaro. I learned that I can persevere when the mountain is so high, my legs are sore, it's cold, and the day has just begun by putting one foot in front of the other and staying in the moment. This year, getting up after shitty camp-site sleep with an 8 hour ride ahead of you is just the same -- one mile after the other. This reaffirmed that I can break through any physical or mental barrier holding me back. But the key is:</p>
<p><strong>5) How bad do you want it?</strong></p>
<p>Listen to this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ (watching is not important) and you will understand. Do you want success more than watching TV? Mindless internet surfing? An unscathed ego? Too often is this answer "no." But how many of us would admit that?</p>
<p>So hopefully during this process I'll starve and tire and hurt. But this will just remind me how bad I want it. Whenever you experience comfort, you are not growing. Remember that.</p>
