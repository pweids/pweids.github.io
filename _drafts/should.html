<p>I should post on this blog more often.</p>
<p>I should get up earlier.<br />
I should go to bed earlier.<br />
I should just sleep more.</p>
<p>I should eat better.<br />
I should drink less.<br />
I should workout more.</p>
<p>I should date a respectable woman.<br />
But should postpone marriage until my late late 20s.</p>
<p>I should learn more.<br />
I should read more.<br />
I should code more.<br />
I should watch TV less.</p>
<p>I should go outside more.<br />
I should talk to strangers more.<br />
I should travel more.</p>
<p>But then again, shouldn't we all? How can we possibly get to a point where we should no longer improve anything?</p>
<p>p.s. This tends to be the bulk of my inner monologue, especially at night while lying in bed. This is why I tend to be driven for self improvement.</p>
<p>p.p.s. I also tend to meet these resolutions poorly. I find it easy to make my future self have to deal with. It's always easier to say what other people should do.</p>
<p>p.p.p.s. The worst part is that I know how to accomplish all of these. We all do. So why don't we do it?</p>
