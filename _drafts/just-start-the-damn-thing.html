<p>I've tried blogging in the past. The excitement and aspirations I had far outweighed my output. Throughout the whole life of the blog, I posted all of two times.</p>
<p>There are three reasons for this.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Perfection</strong>. I can be too much of a perfectionist for my own good. I wanted everything to look perfect, and have the perfect thing to say, written in the best way I can. I let my unrealistic ideals get in the way of the most crucial part: just doing it. I think "they" call this fear of failure? Well shit, I guess I get a dose of that sometimes.</li>
<li><strong>Grandeur</strong>. I wanted every post to be important or monumental. Unsurprisingly, I quickly ran out of topics that are both interesting and relevant to other's lives.</li>
<li><strong>Stress avoidance</strong>. I started to avoid looking at the blog and ignoring it because it reminded me that I failed to post often, that I didn't achieve that perfection, or that I couldn't think of anything important to say. It's like grades or my bank account: out of sight, out of mind.</li>
</ol>
<p>So here's what I've learned. Just starting is over half the battle. Especially with something like a blog, where the first months (or years) worth of posts are going to be absolute shit anyway, just getting in the groove and getting used to putting your thoughts on the web is most important.</p>
<p>This translates itself to other areas of life. Whatever you are thinking of doing, just start. That's the hard part. I'm immediately reminded of Seth Godin's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Poke-Box-Seth-Godin/dp/1936719002/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1330475728&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">Poke The Box</a>," in which the same thesis is pounded into the reader's head for 100-or-so pages.</p>
<p>All of this lovely self-helpy "just start and it'll work out!" stuff is much easier said than done. I know this and experience it every day. But truly, action overcomes fear. Even if it's one little blog post, it will affect your psyche and extend into other aspects of your life.</p>
<p>-- Epilogue --</p>
<p>In fact, I just got back from the gym to reread this post before hitting "Publish." You know what the hardest thing about going to the gym is? It's not each dreadful, grunting, sweat-excreting set -- or even the&nbsp;disappointment&nbsp;of a failed rep. It's just putting on the clothes and overcoming the inertia to relax on my ass and waste time on the internet or reading blogs. Yep, the hardest part is to start. Once I walk through the gym door, I always get 100% of the way there every time.</p>
